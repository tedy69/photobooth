- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### **Response Timeline**

- **Local Processing**: All image processing happens client-side
- **No Data Collection**: Personal data is not collected or stored on servers
- **User Control**: Users can delete all local data at any time

## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### **Code Review Requirements**
- All code changes require security review
- External dependencies are vetted before inclusion
- User input handling must be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities
- File upload functionality requires additional security scrutiny

### **Development Guidelines**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize inputs
const sanitizedInput = input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '');

// ❌ Avoid: Direct DOM manipulation with user input
element.innerHTML = userInput; // Potential XSS

// ✅ Good: Use React's built-in XSS protection
<div>{userInput}</div>
```

### **Dependencies**
- Keep dependencies updated to latest stable versions
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically update vulnerable packages
- Review security advisories for critical dependencies
